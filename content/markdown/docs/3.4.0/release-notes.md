# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.4.0

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.4.0

Maven 3.4.0 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
(POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately.
See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [http://maven.apache.org/](/)
- the maven-user mailing list: [http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html](/mail-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.4.0/](/ref/3.4.0/)

Thank you also for your time and feedback.

Overview about the changes
--------------------------

 * The `JAVA_HOME` discovery has been reduced to simply if `JAVA_HOME` is set
   or not and trying to discover via `which java` nothing more [MNG-6003].

 * The Bootstrapping support via Ant has been removed. You can only bootstrap Maven
   with a previous version of Maven and not with Ant anymore [MNG-5904].

 * Based on problems in using `M2_HOME` related to different Maven versions and 
   to simplify things the usage of `M2_HOME` has been removed and is not
   supported anymore [MNG-5823], [MNG-5836], [MNG-5607].

 * Imported change for windows users: The usage of `%HOME%` has been replaced
   with `%USERPROFILE%` [MNG-6001]

 * Several issues have been reported and fixed related to the `mvn` script either
   for Unix/Linux/Cygwin/Solaris or for Windows. Those issues have been fixed [MNG-5538],
   [MNG-5815], [MNG-5837], [MNG-5849], [MNG-5852], [MNG-5963], [MNG-6022].

 * In Java it is possible to have a ZIP file being used on the classpath as
   well as JAR files. This has not been supported in previous Maven versions. 
   This has been fixed with [MNG-5567].
 
 * Creating source packages during a release of your artifacts you
   usually had to make workaround based on the current state of the super pom 
   where the maven-source-plugin is attached to the life cycle with the `jar` 
   goal. Unfortunately the `jar` goal forkes the life-cycle which is not always 
   the right thing. So in the majority of the cases people add the following 
   workaround to their corporate pom:

``` xml
  <pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
      ..
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>..</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>attach-sources</id>
            <phase>DISABLE_FORKED_LIFECYCLE_MSOURCES</phase>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ..
    </plugins> 
  </pluginManagement>
..
```
  
   The above will detach the maven-source-plugin from the life-cycle and prevent
   calling the `generate-sources` and `generate-resources` twice. But to keep
   generating a source package during the release you need to add the following to
   your pom file:

``` xml
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <inherited>true</inherited>
      <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>attach-sources-no-fork</id>
          <inherited>true</inherited>
          <goals>
            <goal>jar-no-fork</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
```

   The above workaround is no longer needed cause the super pom has been changed
   accordingly [MNG-5940].


 * In Maven 3.3.9 we have removed bindings for maven-ejb3-plugin cause it 
   does not exist. We follow-up and removed the ArtifactHandler for ejb3
   and the `par` lifecycle. This has been fixed with [MNG-6014], 
   [MNG-6017].

 * In previous Maven versions there had been a larger problem related to 
   memory usage in case of very large reactors (200-300 modules or more)
   which caused failures with out of memeory execptions or the need to increase
   the memory settings. This problem has been fixed with [MNG-6030].

 * If you have defined a property within the `.mvn/maven.config` file
   it was not possible to overwrite the property via command line.
   This has been fixed with [MNG-6078][MNG-6078].

Improvements:

 * If you have used Bill of Materials which makes it easier to handle larger
   number of dependencies you might have been faced with a situation like this.
   You do an import like the following: 

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
    <version>${org.springframework.version}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>    
</dependency>
```

   But now you would like to exclude some of transitive dependencies like this:

``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
  <version>${org.springframework.version}</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
      <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>
```
   This has been introduced with [MNG-5600][MNG-5600] to make the users life
   easier.

Bugs:

 * [MNG-5600] - Dependency management import should support exclusions.
 * [MNG-4463] - Version ranges cannot be used for artifacts with 'import' scope

 * [MNG-5387] - Add ability to replace an artifact in mid-build
 * [MNG-5629] - ClosedChannelException from DefaultUpdateCheckManager.read
 * [MNG-5849] - maven can not be found when current directory is drive/root at least on windows 7 64bit
 * [MNG-5863] - default pom's release-profile should invoke source plugin with goal "jar-no-fork" instead of "jar"
 * [MNG-5868] - Adding serval times the same artifact via MavenProjectHelper (attachArtifact) does not produce a failure
 * [MNG-5935] - Optional true getting lost in managed dependencies when transitive
 * [MNG-5939] - Problem doing release when sources are generate as well
 * [MNG-5958] - java.lang.String cannot be cast to org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecyclePhase
 * [MNG-5961] - Maven possibly not aware of log4j2
 * [MNG-5962] - mvn fails when the current directory has spaces in between
 * [MNG-5967] - Dependency updates.
 * [MNG-5971] - Imported dependencies should be available to inheritance processing
 * [MNG-5981] - Plexus lifecycle could be activated too late during overlapping parallel requests
 * [MNG-5984] - Maven core extension resolution ignores repositories from activeByDefault profiles in settings.xml
 * [MNG-6029] - Duplicate conditional and body in MetadataResolutionResult.java Dependency upgrade
 * [MNG-6078] - Can't overwrite properties which have been defined in .mvn/maven.config

Improvements:

 * [MNG-4508] - No way to avoid adding artifactId to site urls

 * [MNG-5883] - Silence unnecessary legacy local repository warning
 * [MNG-5904] - Remove the whole Ant Build
 * [MNG-5931] - Fixing documentation

 * [MNG-5951] - add an option to avoid path addition to inherited URLs
 * [MNG-5968] - Default plugin version updates.
 * [MNG-5975] - Use Java 7's SimpleDateFormat in CLIReportingUtils#formatTimestamp
 * [MNG-5976] - Replace Plexus Utils OS with Commons Lang SystemUtils
 * [MNG-5977] - Improve output readability of our MavenTransferListener implementations
 * [MNG-5992] - Git passwords are exposed as the Super POM still uses Maven Release Plugin 2.3.2
 * [MNG-6014] - Removing ArtifactHandler for ejb3
 * [MNG-6017] - Removing ArtifactHandler for par LifeCycle
 * [MNG-6030] - ReactorModelCache do not used effectively after maven version 3.0.5 which cause a large memory footprint
 * [MNG-6032] - WARNING during build based on absolute path in assembly-descriptor.
 * [MNG-6035] - Upgrade animal-sniffer-maven-plugin to 1.15

New Features:

 * [MNG-1977] - Global dependency exclusions
 * [MNG-2478] - add "resources-filtered" filtered resource directories to super POM

 * [MNG-6037] - add gossip slf4j provider support
 * [MNG-6038] - use Gossip slf4j provider as default logging, since it supports level colorization

Task:

 * [MNG-5954] - Remove outdated maven-embedder/src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

Wish:

 * [MNG-2199] - Support version ranges in parent elements



New Features
------------

 * Hm...[MNG-2478] - add "resources-filtered" filtered resource directories to super POM

   Improving the `Convention over Configuration` paradigm the super POM has been enhanced
   with two supplemental entries for filtered resources.

``` xml
```
